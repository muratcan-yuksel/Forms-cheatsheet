# Forms-cheatsheet
<p>This is a basic cheatsheet about Forms in HTML I made using <link href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/"> as basis. Therefore, all credit goes to <link href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/" </p> <br>
<p>I made the cheatsheet for myself, but it's public so anyone can make use of it</p>
