# Forms-cheatsheet
<p>This is a basic cheatsheet about Forms in HTML I made using <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/">Shay Howe's explanation of forms</a> as basis. Therefore, all credit goes to <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/">This book</a> </p> <br>
<p>I made the cheatsheet for myself, but it's public so anyone can make use of it</p>
